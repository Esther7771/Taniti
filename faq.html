                        There is one hospital and several clinics. The hospital has many multilingual employees.<br>
                        Violent crime is very rare on Taniti, but as tourism increases, there are more reports of pickpocketing and other petty crimes.<br>
                        Taniti enjoys a large number of national holidays, and many tourist attractions and restaurants will be closed on holidays, so visitors should plan accordingly.<br>
                        Taniti uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, but many businesses will also accept euros and yen. Several banks facilitate currency exchange, and many businesses accept major credit cards.
